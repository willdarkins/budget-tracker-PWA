## Usage

- Users can keep track of their finances with a running total located at the top of the screen
- After naming a transaction and amount in the corresponding text fields, selet either button to `+ Add Funds` or `- Subtract Funds`
- Itemized transactions will appear slightly below that section
- Just below that is an html canvas element to provide a visual representation of the user's budget
- If network connection is weak, or there is a loss of connectivity (‚ö†Ô∏è), the application should include data persistence that allows users to continue making transactions
  - When connection is re-established, an altert reading `All saved budget data has been submitted!`will notify the user that all data handled during loss of connectivity has been submitted to the database
  - You can view the cached data in the `Application` tab in Chrome Dev Tools
